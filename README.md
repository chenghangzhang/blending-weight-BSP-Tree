# blending-weight-BSP-Tree

This is a BSP Tree generation algorithm for two Mesh models.
This algorithm can effectively detect the triangles that may intersect with other triangles.

The test models are stored in the "TestModel" floder. 
The codes for inplementing the codes can be found in "BSP3/mBool/BoolOperate/Intersect/Accelerator/BSP/BSPTree/BSPNode.cpp"

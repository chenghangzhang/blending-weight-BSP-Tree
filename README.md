# blending-weight-BSP-Tree

This is a BSP Tree generation algorithm for two Mesh models.

This algorithm can effectively detect the triangles that may intersect with other triangles.

## 1 The Test Models
The test models are stored in the "TestModel" floder. 

## 2 The Codes
The codes to implement the algorithm can be found in "BSP3/mBool/BoolOperate/Intersect/Accelerator/BSP/BSPTree/BSPNode.cpp"
